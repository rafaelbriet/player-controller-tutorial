In this series of three tutorials we learn how to create character movement for 2D games, where we go from creating a new project to adding animations to the character.

In the first tutorial, let's create the project, make the character move in the direction the player wants and collide with obstacles in the scenario.

In the second part of this tutorial, we're going to make the camera follow the character, and then we're going to modify the camera to make it more flexible.

And in the third and final part we will add animations to the character.
